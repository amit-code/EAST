# EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector

### Introduction
This is a tensorflow re-implementation of [EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155v2).
The features are summarized blow:
+ Only **RBOX** part is implemented.
+ A fast Locality-Aware NMS in C++ provided by the paper's author.
+ The pre-trained model provided achieves **80.83** F1-score on ICDAR 2015
	Incidental Scene Text Detection Challenge using only training images from ICDAR 2015 and 2013.
  see [here](http://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4&com=evaluation&view=method_samples&task=1&m=29855&gtv=1) for the detailed results.
+ Differences from original paper
	+ Use ResNet-50 rather than PVANET
	+ Use dice loss (optimize IoU of segmentation) rather than balanced cross entropy
	+ Use linear learning rate decay rather than staged learning rate decay
+ Speed on 720p (resolution of 1280x720) images:
	+ Now
		+ Graphic card: GTX 1080 Ti
		+ Network fprop: **~50 ms**
		+ NMS (C++): **~6ms**
		+ Overall: **~16 fps**
	+ Then
		+ Graphic card: K40
		+ Network fprop: ~150 ms
		+ NMS (python): ~300ms
		+ Overall: ~2 fps

### Installation
1. Any version of tensorflow version > 1.0 should be ok.

### Download
1. Models trained on ICDAR 2013 (training set) + ICDAR 2015 (training set): [BaiduYun link](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1jHWDrYQ) [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3APw5BZJ67ETHNPaU9xUkVoV0U)
2. Resnet V1 50 provided by tensorflow slim: [slim resnet v1 50](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/resnet_v1_50_2016_08_28.tar.gz)

### Train
If you want to train the model, you should provide the dataset path, in the dataset path, a separate gt text file should be provided for each image
and run

```
python3 multigpu_train.py --gpu_list=0 --input_size=512 --batch_size_per_gpu=8 --checkpoint_path=/content/EAST/tmp/east_icdar2015_resnet_v1_50_rbox/ --text_scale=512 --training_data_path=/content/EAST/data/sroie_train/ --geometry=RBOX --learning_rate=0.0001 --num_readers=4 --pretrained_model_path=/content/EAST/data/resnet_v1_50.ckpt
```


If you have more than one gpu, you can pass gpu ids to gpu_list(like --gpu_list=0,1,2,3)

**Note: you should change the gt text file of icdar2015's filename to img_\*.txt instead of gt_img_\*.txt(or you can change the code in icdar.py), and some extra characters should be removed from the file.
See the examples in training_samples/**

**This executable line is updated with reduced num_readers and batch_size_per_gpu, and code is running on top of pre-trained checkpoints. 
   Update current checkpoint file path in 'checkpoint' file in east_icdar2015_resnet_v1_50_rbox folder**

### Test
run
```
python eval.py --test_data_path=/tmp/images/ --gpu_list=0 --checkpoint_path=/tmp/east_icdar2015_resnet_v1_50_rbox/ \
--output_dir=/tmp/
```

a text file will be then written to the output path.
**Note: with current code right test results will only come on GPU based enviornment, so make sure you run eval.py on GPU**


### Examples
Here are some test examples on icdar2015, enjoy the beautiful text boxes!
